Todo
----

   - Quicken up LZSS deflate (long enough match; unthorough lazy eval)
   - Figure out why 'gzip --best' compresses to a smaller size
   - Write documentation
   - dtypes.h: Ensure zseb_32_t is 32-bit in stead of assert()
   - Fixed Huffman trees hardcoded?
   - Why is the sys time so large? (gzip quasi zero)
   - Build tree in __prefix_lengths__
   - file.write --> immediate to disk or to buffer?
   - Seems like zseb_64_t for hash_head requires long time... (many cycles)
